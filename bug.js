This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common in asynchronous operations where the state might not be updated immediately after a fetch or other operation.

```javascript
// Incorrect
const [data, setData] = useState();

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('some-api')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setData(data));
}, []);

return (
  <Text>{data.name}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
);
```

The `data` variable is initially `undefined`. The `useEffect` hook fetches data asynchronously, but the component tries to render before `setData` is called.
